# KPN
Repository created to commit the KPN assessment code 

# Completed features:
* Available Products LWC, with the ability to add items to the "Order Products" component
* Order Products LWC. If the product is already added, it will increment the quantity by 1
* Inserts of Order Items and update of the Order
* "Activate" button that changes the Order Status field to "Activated"
* After it has been activated, the user is no longer able to click "Activate" or add products to the order.

* Test classes (100% coverage for AvailableProductsController, 93% for OrderProductsController)

# TBD:
* Remove button added to the records in Order Products, but not functional
* APEX Callout being developed, but not finished thus far.
* Sorting; started with the development at early stages, but didn't followed through
